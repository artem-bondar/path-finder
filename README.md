# Path finder

A simple Dijkstra's web path finder made as a coursework on 3rd year of CMC MSU studying (see *coursework.pdf* and *coursework.tex* for sources).

Just choose two vertices and the shortest path between them will be shown.

 - *orange* color is for shortest path by length
 - *green* color is for shortest time by time (measuring given node weights)

Node weights can be displayed by switcher, in this format: *length/speed* on node.
